Project: A Predictive Maintenance Dashboard
An AI-powered predictive maintenance system that detects equipment failures, helping manufacturers reduce downtime and save millions in maintenance costs.

Technical Stack
Frontend: Streamlit
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Random Forest
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Deployment: Streamlit Cloud
Imbalance Handling: SMOTE, Class Weighting

Key Features of the dashboard
- Real-time equipment health monitoring
- AI-powered failure probability predictions
- Interactive factory dashboard
- Business impact calculator
- Professional web interface

Skills 
- End-to-end ML pipeline development
- Class imbalance handling (SMOTE)
- Model deployment and serving
- Web application development
- Business value translation

Business Case
This system addresses the problem of unplanned equipment downtime in manufacturing. By detecting failures 7-30 days in advance, factories can:
- Schedule maintenance during planned downtime
- Reduce emergency repair costs by 90%
- Increase overall equipment effectiveness
- For medium-sized factories, it can save an estimated $1.3M annually.
